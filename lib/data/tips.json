    "Property managers get 20+ vendor calls a week. Lead with the ROI — $10-20 net profit per unit monthly is the hook.",

    "When a property manager says 'we already have a vendor' — ask when the contract expires. Plant the seed.",
    "Track every call, every email, every visit. The data tells you what's working and what's not.",
    "Garden-style apartments (2-3 story, spread out) are ideal starter properties. Easier routes, simpler logistics.",
